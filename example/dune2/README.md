Given a file `foo.ml` that contains a C stub and a 'foostubs.c' that implements.

Generate some dune rules, for example by doing this:
```
(include dune.analysis.inc)
(rule
 (deps
  (:mlfiles (glob_files_rec *.ml))
  (:cfiles (glob_files_rec *.c))
 )
 (action (with-stdout-to dune.analysis.inc.gen
  (run %{bin:lintcstubs-dune-rules} %{mlfiles} %{cfiles})
 ))
)

(rule
 (alias runtest)
 (action
  (diff dune.analysis.inc dune.analysis.inc.gen)))
```

And then running:
```
rm -f dune.analysis.inc; touch dune.analysis.inc && dune runtest --auto-promote
```

You will have to create a `compile_commands.json`, e.g. by using `bear`:
```
bear -- dune build @cstubs
```

(where `@cstubs` is an alias generated by the above tool).

Now you can run `dune build @analyze` to trigger a static analysis.

TODO: this is very experimental.
